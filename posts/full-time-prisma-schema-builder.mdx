During the last couple of years, I've asked all of you who use Prisma Schema Builder whether or not you would be interested in an improved version of the app, and I've gotten such amazing feedback!

I recently quit my full-time job to work on personal projects - and Prisma Schema Builder came to mind very quickly. Initially, I built this for myself. I found it hard to write schemas in code, and to get an overview of all the relationships in the app.

Now, my goal is to build a way better version of Prisma Schema Builder. And to do so in under 5 months, since that's the amount of money I've got saved up.

## What will it include?

### Phase 1

- Overhauled user interface
- Desktop app for local schemas
- MongoDB support
- Entity relationship diagrams
- Team collaboration

### Phase 2

- LLM for scaffolding schemas
- Schema agnostic (not only Prisma!)

## Status?

I've started working a little bit on the new interface, and I wanted to give you a sneak peek.
