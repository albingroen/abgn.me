![Setup 1](https://res.cloudinary.com/albin-groen/image/upload/w_auto,q_auto/v1709805704/DSCF0874-min_werfyw.jpg)

I recently moved in together with my girlfriend in a new appartment in a city outside Stockholm.

I then decided to revamp my desk setup, since I will be working more from home going forward. This is the result!

## Items

### Non-tech

- [Desk](https://www.dpj.se/hoj-och-sankbart-skrivbord/14710-185726-di-650-skrivbord-hoej-och-saenkbart.html#/81-stativ-vit/166-storlek-160x80_cm/663-bordsskiva-ek). This desk is a 160x80cm sit-stand desk from a company called Brizely of Scandinavia. It's a very sturdy desk, and not too expensive at around $600.
- [Chair](https://www.ergocare.se/stolar/frapettsolo3660.html?). This char is definitely a special one. It's an ergonomic chair made for easier switching between sitting and standing. It's comfortable, but not for our hours on end, thus encouraging one to stand more.
- [Desk mat](https://oakywood.shop/products/felt-cork-desk-mat?variant=40323708420157). High-quality desk mat for a good price from a company called Oakywood. I do wish it was a little bit bigger though!
- [Drawer](https://www.ikea.com/p/micke-ladhurts-pa-hjul-vit-90213078/). MICKE drawer unit from IKEA. This was _not easy_ to build...
- <span className="font-medium">Water bottle</span>. Don't know which brand it
  is really. But it's one of those ceramic, keep-your-water-cold-for-24-hours
  ones.

### Tech

- [Lamp](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/nymane-work-lamp-with-wireless-charging-white-40448611/). A desk lamp from IKEA that has a nice warm light, provides you with a wireless charger, as well as a USB 3 port.
- [Camera](https://www.sony.com/electronics/kameror-med-utbytbart-objektiv/ilce-6000-body-kit). Sony A6000. Mostly use this as a webcam. For taking photos I use the [Fujifilm x100v](https://fujifilm-x.com/products/cameras/x100v/).
- [Charger](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPL72Z/A/belkin-boost%E2%86%91charge%E2%84%A2-pro-tr%C3%A5dl%C3%B6s-2-i-1-laddare-med-magsafe). Belkin 2-in-1 charger from the Apple store. Works quite well when I do app development as well!
- [Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/). Ultimate Hacking Keyboard (v1). Best keyboard every in my opinion. I've tried endless of keyboards, and always come back to this one. I love it as a programmer, but I think it's great for writing as well. I wrote a review about it a few years ago. You can read that [here](https://abgn.me/blog/my-ultimate-hacking-keyboard-review).
- [Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005179.html). Logitech MX Ergo Pro. Not for everybody, but I like myself a trackball mouse with modern features.
- [Display](https://www.apple.com/studio-display/). Apple Studio Display with high-adjustable stand. Highly recommend!

## Thoughts

I really enjoy this new workspace. It fits me perfectly, and I don't think I will change much in the coming time. I hope you found this interesting, and perhaps even found some new toys for setup :)
