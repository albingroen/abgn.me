excerpt: "Time, care, taste and intentionality. Here are a few products I think qualify as great software."

Throughout my years as a designer and engineer (design engineer?) I've been thinking a lot about quality in things around me. Furniture, architecture, city planning, everyday things, from cups to pens to screwdrivers. And, also, of course quality in software. 

In physical things, I think quality is easier to spot. You can see it on the materials, the finish, the design standing the test of time. In software, I find this more difficult. How do you define qualitative software? And, how does it tie in to agentic coding? I'm not sure. But I thought I would start with listing some products that, what I think at least, qualify as *great software*.

Raycast is, among many other things, at it's core, an application launcher for your computer. See it as a replacement for Spotlight on macOS, or the start menu on Windows.

I've been using it for many years, and all I can say is, the feeling of using it is the same as you get you sit in a really nice chair. It feels well built, using proper materials that will last a liftime.

Linear is a issue tracking tool, like Jira, but built for the modern area. This product screams quality. Everything from their design library, to the performance, their offline support and finally, seamless real-time syncing.

It's all top of the line. It feels like wearing a luxury watch. It does its job, it keeps time, but when you take a peek at the inner workings, you get amazed by all the little details they've engineered to perfection.
